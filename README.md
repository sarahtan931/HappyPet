# HappyPet 

Pet owners want to give their pets nutritious food as meals and treats. A majority of pet owners feed human foods to their pets but many of these foods are toxic or unsafe for pet. Typically, pet owners search the Internet for safety data, but search results are often contradictory and difficult to parse.

HappyPet is a mobile application that allows pet owners to search and access food safety data seamlessly. HappyPet contains data for both dogs and cats, and supports queries both by ingredient name and product UPC code. The application also offers barcode scanning for UPC queries. Users can create profiles for each of their pets, and HappyPet will return tailored results for each pet with recommendations for maximum intake and warnings for consumption if applicable. HappyPet is built using React Native for the frontend, and Node.js/Express.js for the Backend. Food data is collected using the Spoonacular API, and application data is stored in a MongoDB database.
